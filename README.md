# ME cleaner

A cleaner for Intel ME/TXE images.

This tools removes any unnecessary partition from an Intel ME/TXE firmware, reducing
its size and its ability to interact with the system.
It should work both with coreboot and with the factory firmware.

In order to seal the loophole mentioned with [this article](https://semiaccurate.com/2017/05/01/remote-security-exploit-2008-intel-platforms/),
You HAD BETTER apply this tool to your box's firmware, rather than installing patches from intel;-)

Currently this tool:
 * Scans the FPT (partition table) and checks that everything is correct
 * Removes any partition entry (except for FTPR) from FPT
 * Removes any partition except for the fundamental one (FTPR)
 * Removes the EFFS presence flag
 * Corrects the FPT checksum
 * Removes any non-essential LZMA or Huffman compressed module from the FTPR partition (pre-Skylake only)
 * Relocates the remaining parts of the FTPR partition to the top of the ME region (pre-Skylake only)
 * Checks the validity of the RSA signature of the FTPR partition

Don't forget to power cycle your PC after flashing the modified ME/TXE image
(power off and power on, not just reboot).
